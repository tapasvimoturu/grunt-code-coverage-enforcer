# grunt-code-coverage-enforcer

> Enforces code coverage thresholds for a project with lcov files. This means it works with a wide range of code coverage tools like blanketjs, istanbul, .....

## Introduction

Most code coverage enforcers are tied to a specific code coverage tool like blanketjs or istanbul.
This plugin works on the lcov file that can be generated by most test runners.

As a result you can work with any tests runners that are capable of generating the widely used LCOV file format.

## Why is our plugin better

Most other coverage threshold tools fail the build only when you have a test and the test doesn't meet the threshold criteria.  **Most tools will actually pass the build if you dont write any tests for your project**.

**This plugin will check and fail if there are files that have not been covered at all.**

You can always exclude the files that you specifically do not want to test for coverage. Since the policy is opt-out, less files will slip through the cracks ;-)

----

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install grunt-code-coverage-enforcer --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-code-coverage-enforcer');
```

## The "code-coverage-enforcer" task

## Enabling lcov reporter in your test runner.

You will need to enable lcov reporter in your test runner. The specific config for this may vary for each runner. Please check your specific runner for instructions.

### Sample Intern config
```js
intern:  {
   runner: {
        options: {
            config: "<intern- config>",
            runType: "runner",
            reporters: ["console", "lcov"]
        }
    }
  }
```



### Sample Karma config 
(http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/coverage.html)
```js
coverageReporter = {
  type : 'lcovonly',
  dir : 'coverage/',
  file : 'lcov.info'
}
```

### Sample Istanbul config 
(https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul, https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-istanbul-coverage, https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-mocha-istanbul)

Cli version of istanbul has a report parameter that you need to set to lcov or lcovonly. By default it should generate the lcov files.
Most istanbul plugin allow this to be passed into their grunt config as well.

Here is one suc example for the grunt-mocha-istanbul plugin

```js
  options: {
                    reportFormats: ['cobertura','lcovonly']
          }
```

### Mocha
Mocha has an lcov reporter that can be foounf here https://nodejsmodules.org/pkg/mocha-lcov-reporter
You can also use istanbul with Mocha using the plugin here 
https://github.com/pocesar/grunt-mocha-istanbul





This should typically generate an lcov.info file that will specified as input into the code-coverage-enforcer plugin.


### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `code-coverage-enforcer` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  "code-coverage-enforcer": {
    options: {
        lcovfile: "lcov.info",
        lines: 60,
        functions: 60,
        branches: 60,
        src: "src",
        includes: ["src/**/*.js"],
        excludes: ["src/uncoveredfile.js"]
    }
  },
})
```

the default threshold values are 
```js
          {
            lines: 50,
            functions: 50,
            branches: 0,
            includes: ["**/*.js"],
            src: process.cwd(),
            excludes: []
        }
```

### Options

#### lines
Type: `Number`
Default value: `50`

A Number value that is used to specify in % the line coverage required.

#### functions
Type: `Number`
Default value: `50`

A Number value that is used to specify in % the function coverage required.

#### branches
Type: `Number`
Default value: `50`

A Number value that is used to specify in % the branches coverage required.

#### src
Type: `string`
Default value: `src`

The location of the folder within which we will search for files.

#### includes
Type: `matcher`
Default value: `*`

The matcher required to compare files within the src location that are to be included


#### excludes
Type: `[matcher]`
Default value: `[]`

The matchers required to compare files within the src location that are to be excluded.




### Usage Examples

#### Default Options
In this example, the default options are used 

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  "code-coverage-enforcer": {
    options: {
        lcovfile: "lcov.info",
        includes: ["src/**/*.js"],
        excludes: ["src/uncoveredfile.js"]
    }
  },
})
```

#### Custom Options
In this example, custom options are used to specify the threshold limits
```js
grunt.initConfig({
  "code-coverage-enforcer": {
    options: {
        lcovfile: "lcov.info",
        lines: 60,
        functions: 60,
        branches: 60,
        src: "src",
        includes: ["src/**/*.js"],
        excludes: ["src/uncoveredfile.js"]
    }
  },
})
```


### Recommendations

We recommend using a specific task names build acceptance that will run the code-coverage-enforcer along with other build acceptance type of tasks.

Here is an example config that should go into your Gruntfile 
```js

    grunt.registerTask("build-acceptance", ["code-coverage-enforcer"]);
```

You can now simply invoke this from command line using

> grunt build-acceptance
